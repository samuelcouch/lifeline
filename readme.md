# Lifeline

When you know you'll be without your favorite package managers -- call lifeline.

## Usage
Before leaving for a roadtrip, make sure to call `lifeline [FRAMEWORK...]` to download a local copy of your favorite packages.

To see what will be downloaded beforehand pass it the `--preview` for a list of packages that will be downloaded locally.

`lifeline list` will output a list of supported frameworks and languages.
